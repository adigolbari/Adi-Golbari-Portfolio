# **Adi Golbari - Data Science Portfolio**

A year and a half ago, I left my previous job during pregnancy, a war, and with my husband in reserves, to chase my dream of becoming a Data Scientist (don’t try this at home 🙃). 

Now, I’m a Master’s student in Data Science at Ben Gurion University. 

Since most jobs require experience (which can only be gained on the job) the classic junior paradox, I decided to gain practical experience on my own.

My goal is to explore core topics in the data science field. 
Check out my project below, and if you want to connect and get the full vibes, feel free to reach me 😉.
